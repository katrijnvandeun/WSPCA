The simulation study can be replicated by first creating the data (revision_GenerateDatavPunif.m) and then analyzing these data using the 
matlab script (revision_analysis_simulateddata_Punif.m). For the SPC analysis as implemented in the R package and for creating the box plots
in the paper, we refer to the R folder.

The analysis of influenza data can be obtained by running the script (script_AnalysisInfluenzaData).
